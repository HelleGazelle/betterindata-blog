## Next steps
With this basic setup we could do a lot of cool things. Here are some ideas.

### Lift it to production
Spin up a server in the cloud and setup the containers there. Add CRON jobs or even a scheduling service like Apache Airflow that triggers the data import regulary.

### Popularity over time
One could track the number of submissions or upvotes for the "jokes" subreddit over time to see if there are any patterns or trends in popularity. For example, you could look for spikes in activity on certain days of the week or at certain times of day.

### Topic modeling
You could use natural language processing (NLP) techniques like topic modeling to identify the most common themes and topics in the "jokes" subreddit. This could help you understand the types of humor that are most popular and see if there are any emerging trends or patterns over time.

### User analysis
You could analyze the posting and commenting behavior of individual users on the "jokes" subreddit to see if there are any power users or influential contributors. This could help you identify potential brand ambassadors or influencers to work with.

### Sentiment analysis
You could use sentiment analysis to evaluate the tone and mood of individual submissions and comments on the "jokes" subreddit. This could help you understand the emotional context in which jokes are being shared and identify any potential negative sentiment or backlash.

### Geolocation analysis
You could use geolocation analysis to identify the geographic distribution of users who are posting or commenting on the "jokes" subreddit. This could help you understand how different regions or cultures respond to different types of humor.
